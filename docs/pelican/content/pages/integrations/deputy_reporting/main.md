#### Purpose

Data Deputy Reporting is comprised of a number of endpoints used by the Digideps frontend 
application to send Deputy Reports and their supporting documents to the Sirius case management 
system so that cases may be administered by OPG staff.

This is accomplished by a process in which documents are set to 'QUEUED' on 
submission of a report and supporting documents. An ECS task then polls for the queued 
documents every 5 minutes (or whatever the period is set to in the respective environment). 

It then sends them one by one to our endpoints as a standard http request with content type 
`application/json` and a `base64` encoded payload. After validation, this is forwarded to 
the the Sirius API and the documents are stored in S3 on the Sirius side and become visible 
to the Sirius case workers.

#### Consumers of this API

* Sirius - [opg-sirius](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-sirius)
* DigiDeps - [opg-use-an-lpa](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/digideps)

#### Integration Repositories

* Deputy Reporting - [opg-data-lpa-codes](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-data-deputy-reporting)

#### Integration Location

* Sirius Account (development, preproduction, production)
* EU West 1

#### Security

URLs to the endpoint's DNS is publicly accessible but locked down by AWS Authentication to only 
be accessible from the ECS task's role of the scheduled polling service from the respective 
Digideps account for the environment. 

#### Setup Local Environment

From the root of the repository you can type `docker-compose up -d`. This will bring up four services, 
2 python connexion services (that mock the aws gateway validation and sirius rest api validation 
respectively) and a postgres database and pact broker image for running pact tests.

#### Setup Branch Environment

Branch environments are set up through the CI pipeline. However if you wish to build one manually 
for whatever reason then you can run the following (replacing <myworkspace> with whatever you want 
your workspace to be called):
```
cd terraform/environment
export TF_WORKSPACE=<myworkspace>
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform init
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform plan
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform apply  
```

More information on working with workspaces can be found in the technologies used tab.

#### ADRs

and [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-data/tree/master/docs/architecture).

#### Testing

Testing is accomplished by using a combination of unit tests and contract testing (using pact).

Unit tests can be run locally by running the following from the root directory of the repo:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./lambda_functions/v1/requirements/dev-requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

Local Pact testing instructions in progress.
